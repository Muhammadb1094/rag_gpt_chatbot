Answer from GPT for prompt 'what was the dog name' Asked By User bilal  is of town and the weather wasn't particularly good. Sorge believes that the word-
of-mouth buzz created by Friday's event and the speed in which it traveled online 
generated his best weekend ever.  
Marketing stunts can drive a single day of traffic, but social media events can 
build sustainable and real -time word -of-mouth results that c an have an impact on 
long-term sales.  
Resourcing Social Media Engagement and Events  
 
From organizing  events to talking with customers on Twitter , it seems like these 
activities would take a lot of time. They do. Sorge has two solutions for small 
business owners. The first is to set the right expectations.  When using Twitter , 
Sorge has set the expectatio n that he will respond back to questions extremelyreward ed with revenue?  Sorge has used social media platforms like Twitter , 
Facebook and,  most recently , Foursquare to drive record sales for AJ Bombers.  
 On 
Foursquare D ay, Sorge set out to top his previous efforts, this time using 
Foursquare and a boat. He held an event at his restaurant that allowed customers to earn Foursquare's "I'm On A Boat!" Badge, which requires users to check- in to a location that has been tagged "boat." Sorge partnered with a local 
outdoor retailer to have boats available at AJ Bombers so customers could earn 
the badge.  
 Once he decided what badg e he was going to help his customers earn, it took a 
couple of days of work to organize the most successful single- day Foursquare-
based restaurant event. During the event , more than 231 people had checked- in 
to AJ Bombers'  "I'm On A Boat!" Badge party . The event resulted in the single- 
best day of sales ever for the restaurant, and Sorge said he even had to turn 
away customers because he didn't have the room to accommodate everyone.  
 The Difference Between a Social Media Event and a Marketing Stunt  
 
Some marketers may argue that event marketing is nothing new and that using a location- based service 
like Foursquare is just adding a 
new wrinkle. This is the wrong 
assumption. In interviewing Sorge, 
my biggest takeaway wasn't that Friday was his biggest sales day ever;  it was that Saturday was his 
5th biggest sales day ever and that Sunday was one of his  best as well. He 
explained that during the weekend, not hing special had happened to caus e this 
burst in sales, especially considering professional sports teams were playing out
